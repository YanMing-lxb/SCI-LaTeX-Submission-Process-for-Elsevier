\section{Introduction}


With the development of technologies such as fifth generation mobile communication \cite{Lau_2022}, which is driving the rapid development of radio frequency technology toward high-speed, miniaturization \cite{Matsuzawa_2002,Miao.Jin.ea_2013}, and multifunctionality, the heat flux of electronic chips is also increasing.
\Nomenclature
The high temperature generated by the chip and the large temperature gradient near the chip will reduce the lifetime of integrated circuits.
