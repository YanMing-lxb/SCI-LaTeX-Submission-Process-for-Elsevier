Embedded module with ribs and pin-fins embedded in microchannel heat sink below chip.
\cref{tab:structure-parameter} shows the geometric parameters of the embedded module.
To investigate the effect of ribs and pin-fins on fluid flow and heat transfer on the embedded module in MCHS-RPFEM, three parameters were selected to be varied.
These three parameters are relative rib height ($\alpha$), relative pin-fin height ($\beta$), and relative number of auxiliary channels ($\gamma$).
