\subsection{Effect of geometric prameters on hydrothermal performance}

In order to explore the influence of the geometric parameters of MCHS-RPFEM on the flow and heat transfer performance, several parameters were selected for research: the relative rib height ($\alpha$), the relative pin-fin height ($\beta$), and the relative number of auxiliary channels ($\gamma$).




\subsubsection{The effect of relative rib height  ($\alpha$)}
The ratio of rib height to channel height is defined as relative rib height:
